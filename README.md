# Ignite Feed

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It was developed as part of the Rocketseat Ignite program in 2023 to showcase a social media feed named "Ignite Feed."

## Installation

Before you can run the application, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn installed on your machine. If you don't have them, you can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-vite-ignite-feed.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd react-vite-ignite-feed
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm or Yarn:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to fit your needs. Enjoy building with React and Vite in the development environment!
